10.04 gitian mingw32 builds binaries that crash in the SSE2 code.
MacOS X's 10.5 compatible ancient gcc is missing both the intrinsics and fails to build inline assembly,
however this may not be needed at all as Intel Macs are to be assumed to always have SSE2.
Linux32 and Linux64 works.

None of this is good because it requires manually editing the Makefile generated by qmake.
